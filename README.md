# The Catala book

This book relies on the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) utility
for creating HTML books from Markdown files.

The dependencies for building the book can be installed through `cargo` with:

    cargo install mdbook mdbook-admonish mdbook-mermaid mdbook-toc mdbook-tocjs mdbook-linkcheck

The book can be previewed locally
in a Web browser using the following command:

    mdbook serve --open

This book should incorporate the principles laid out in the
[Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for writing good documentation.
