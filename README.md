# The Catala book

This book relies on the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) utility
for creating HTML books from Markdown files. The book can be previewed locally
in a Web browser using the following command:

    mdbook serve --open

This book should incorporate the principles laid out in the
[Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for writing good documentation.
