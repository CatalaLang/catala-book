# The Catala language

Welcome to the reference of the Catala language! The goal of this chapter is to
convey itemized explanations of each feature of the language, with examples and
tips.


In this reference, a language feature is often akin to a syntax element as
presented in the [syntax cheat
sheet](https://assets.catala-lang.org/syntax.pdf). But unlike the syntax cheat
sheet, this reference contextualises the features, motivates the design choices
and give examples of uses.

However, unlike the
[Catala tutorial](./2-0-tutorial.md), this reference guide is not meant to teach
you Catala, as language features are presented in a taxonomic order, and
each feature explanation does not always build upon the explanation of features
presented earlier.

Rather, the goal of the reference is to offer a place for you to learn about a
specific Catala feature when you encounter or need it, after a first learning
phase of Catala through the tutorial.

~~~admonish tip
If you have a question but don't know to
which language feature it corresponds, check out the
Catala-specific [FAQ](./4-2-catala-specific.md).
