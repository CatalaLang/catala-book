# Creating your first Catala program

Now that you have installed the Catala tooling, you can test its correct
execution with the equivalent of a `Hello, world!` program.

Catala programs are just text files that can be handled by any text editor/IDE.
Hence, to kickstart your Catala development, we recommend you open your favorite
text editor.

~~~admonish info title="Text editor/IDE support"
The Catala maintenance team currently only provides full support for the
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor (syntax highlighting, language server, formatter).

However
the Catala community has written a [number of plugins for other text editors
and IDEs](https://github.com/CatalaLang/catala/tree/master/syntax_highlighting), whose maintenance is performed on a best-effort basis. Please contribute if you add support to your favorite text editor!
~~~

In your text editor/IDE, create a new folder for your Catala developments (for
instance named `catala`) and inside it an empty text file (for instance named
`tutorial.catala_en`).
