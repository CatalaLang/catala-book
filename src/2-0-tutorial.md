# Tutorial : computing your taxes

Welcome to this tutorial, whose objective is to guide you through the features
of the Catala language and teach you how to annotate a simple legislative text
using the language, and get out an executable program that compute your taxes!

This tutorial does not cover the installation of Catala. For more information
about this, please refer to the [installation
section](./1-1-getting_started.md). If you want follow this tutorial locally,
read the [section about creating your first program](./1-2-first.md) and simply
copy-paste the code snippets of the tutorial into your Catala program file.

~~~admonish info title="Need more information?"
At any point, please refer to [the Catala syntax cheat
sheet](https://catalalang.github.io/catala/syntax.pdf) or the [reference
guide](./5-catala.md) for an exhaustive view of the syntax and features of
Catala; this tutorial is rather designed to ease you into the language and its
common use patterns.
~~~

There are three sections in the tutorial, that are designed to be complete
in order as they cover increasingly difficult and advanced features of the
language:
* the [first section](./2-1-basic-blocks.md) is about the basic blocks of the language programs
  with simple data flow;
* the [second section](./2-2-conditionals-exceptions.md) is about what makes Catala
  unique: its first-class handling of conditional definitions and exceptions;
* the [third section](./2-3-list-modular.md) is about scaling up the codebase with
  multiple functions and lists of items.

~~~admonish note title="Practising the tutorial"
This tutorial is designed to be an interactive experience. While reading the
text of the different sections, we encourage you to create a `tutorial.catala_en`
empty text
file and fill it by copy-pasting the code snippets presented. Through this
companion file, you will be able to see first-hand how the Catala typechecker
and interpreter behaves on the different examples, and even make your own
experiences by tweaking the code yourself.

Moreover, after each section, some hands on exercises will allow you to put
to test what you have learnt. We encourage you to complete these exercises
before moving on to the next section.
~~~

You should be all set to begin now. Godspeed!
