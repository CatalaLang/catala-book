# Getting started

Welcome to the getting started chapter! This chapter is all about setting you up
for the beginning of your journey into Catala. First, you'll need to [install
Catala on your machine](./1-1-0-installing.md), as Catala is not a *Software as
a Service* but rather a fully-fledged programming language toolchain. Second,
you should test whether everything is OK by [creating and
running](./1-2-first.md) your first, "Hello, world!"-like Catala program.

You will get introduced to :
* the Catala compiler `catala` ;
* the Catala build system `clerk`;
* the Catala IDE tooling (language plugin and formatter).
